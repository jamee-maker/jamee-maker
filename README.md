Making the decision to pursue a career in software development was an easy one. I am a fellow at Pursuit, an intensive 12-month software engineering fellowship with a 9% acceptance rate. Joining this fellowship has been a highlight-  as I am excited to be part of the next generation of tech! 

I have a passion for music, and in particular, audio mixing. I'm familiar with Logic Pro X, Reason, and FL Studio. My background in audio has provided me with an appreciation for attention to fine detail, which I aim to incorporate into my software development.  I love soccer in any way, shape, or form. I also enjoy fitness, combat training, and yoga. 

As a team player, I believe that we are are only as strong as our weakest link and I value an environment in which people are always trying to improve themselves or those around them. I am interested in a career path that values progress, and moving towards a more just, greener, and better world.
